# Deploy

Pilcrow builds to a static site in `dist/`. There is no server runtime to configure.

## Before you deploy

Set `site.url` in `src/config.ts` to your production URL. It is used for canonical links, RSS, and the sitemap.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.12 or newer.
- pnpm, pinned via the `packageManager` field in `package.json` (currently pnpm 12). Corepack cannot run pnpm 12; install the pinned version directly:

```sh
npm i -g "$(node -p "require('./package.json').packageManager.split('+')[0]")"
```

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests: install, `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, a Lighthouse run, and an internal link check against `dist`. Use it as a reference for what a deploy pipeline should verify before shipping.
